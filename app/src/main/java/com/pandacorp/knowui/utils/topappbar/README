This package contains files needed for work of FixedTopAppBar and the composable itself,
modified by replacing the lines:
```
val fraction = if (colorTransitionFraction > 0.01f) 1f else 0f
    val appBarContainerColor by animateColorAsState(
        targetValue = colors.containerColor(fraction)
        animationSpec = spring(stiffness = Spring.StiffnessMediumLow)
    )
```
with:
```
val colorTransitionFraction = scrollBehavior?.state?.overlappedFraction ?: 0f
    val appBarContainerColor by rememberUpdatedState(colors.containerColor(colorTransitionFraction))
```
to make animation of background changes smoother and synchronize it with the background color changes of all other
composables in the app.
Also some comments with unresolved references were removed, removed the ability to make the title's gravity center
