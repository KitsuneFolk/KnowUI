# KnowUI
This is an example-app written in Kotlin Compose that uses Firestore to get facts with tags and Firebase Storage to get images to show them.
This app also uses:
  * SplashScreen dependencie to show the splash screen while launching
  * Fragula to implement the SwipeBack feature
  * Coil to load images asynchronously
There are 3 available languages and 4 different themes you can try! 

To run this app you would need to create a Firestore and Firebase Storage project(it's free) and download the file google-services.json to the app directory.

Here are some screenshots of the app:
